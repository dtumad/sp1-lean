# Build profiling: which tool answers which question

The toolkit for finding out where build time goes, verified against the pinned toolchain and
`.lake/packages` (2026-09). Point-in-time numbers never live here: they go to the review artifact
that motivated them (`docs/audits/`, the `build-time` issues on the fork). Read together with
Clean's `doc/performance-problems.md` (the *why* of slow elaboration) — this file is about the
*measuring*.

## The one-line rules

- **Lake's `Built X (Ns)` is wall time of that job inside a parallel build**, not CPU and not the
  module's cost alone: two cold builds of the same tree differ by ≈ 5 % in the sum and by a median
  8 % per module, with a long tail beyond ±15 %. Judge a CI pair by the **sum, the wall and the
  critical path**; judge a *module* by a **solo CPU timing**.
- **`lake env lean <file>` applies neither `moreLeanArgs` nor `[leanOptions]`** and exits 0 on a
  stack overflow. It is not a gate and not a measurement. Pass the package flags (see
  `scripts/lean_flags.py`) or measure with `lake build <module>`.
- **Lake has no `-j`.** Its concurrency is the Lean runtime thread pool of the `lake` process —
  `LEAN_NUM_THREADS` (default: all cores), inherited by every child `lean`, which by default *also*
  uses all cores for async proof elaboration. `-j<n>` for the children goes through `moreLeanArgs`
  (traced: changes it → everything rebuilds); `LEAN_NUM_THREADS` is not traced.
- **Label every number** with machine, parallelism (solo / N-core / CI 4 vCPU) and what it
  measures (CPU, wall, `Built`). Hosted runners alternate CPU models (±10–15 %): record `lscpu`
  and compare same-model pairs.
- Lean elaborates proof bodies on parallel threads: a module's **CPU can exceed its wall**, and the
  profiler's `blocked (unaccounted)` is the main thread waiting for those tasks. Read
  `simp`/`tactic execution`/`type checking` together with it.

## Whole build

| Question | Tool | Invocation | Output / gotcha |
|---|---|---|---|
| What did a CI build spend, per module? | Lake `Built` lines + `scripts/profile_aggregate.py --lake-log` | `gh api repos/dtumad/sp1-lean/actions/jobs/<job id>/logs > ci.log; scripts/profile_aggregate.py --lake-log ci.log --out out/build-log --top 30` | ranking, per-pillar sums (`.md/.tsv/.json`). The GitHub log carries a timestamp per line; a local `lake build` log does not. `gh run view --log` is empty while a run is in progress; use the jobs API. |
| Is the build critical-path-bound or throughput-bound? What can P processors never beat? | `scripts/build_semantics.py` (`critical_path.md`) | `scripts/build_semantics.py --lake-log ci.log --out out/bsem [--processors 4]` | longest import-weighted path through the built modules, `max(CP, Σ/P)`, the path itself. CP > Σ/P → shorten the path; otherwise only CPU-seconds help. Dependencies outside the import graph (Clean, …) count in Σ but not in the path. |
| How many jobs were running when? Is there a single-job tail? | `scripts/build_semantics.py` (`timeline.md`, timestamped logs only) | same command | span, average/peak concurrency, seconds at ≤ 1 / ≤ 2 running jobs, the longest solo stretch (a critical-path module running alone). Jobs under 1 s are left out. |
| Did my PR move the build? | `scripts/build_semantics.py --compare` | `scripts/build_semantics.py --lake-log base.log --compare head.log --out out/cmp --touched touched.txt` (`touched.txt` = `git diff --name-only base..head`) | `compare.md`: both totals and critical paths, the touched modules' deltas, largest regressions/improvements among common modules, a noise check over untouched modules. |
| Which layer / stratum / claim closure pays what? | `scripts/build_semantics.py` (`layers.md`, `claims.md`, `unreached.md`, `chips.md`) | as above, optionally `--profile-dir <solo sweep>` for the category split | the cost-versus-claims tables of `docs/audits/2026-09-build-semantics.md`. |
| A controlled cold / warm measurement on the CI runner, without touching the shared cache | `.github/workflows/build-experiment.yml` | `gh workflow run build-experiment.yml --ref <branch> -f label=<tag> -f restore=none [-f lean_num_threads=3] [-f targets=…]` | job summary: runner inventory, `time -v` (max RSS, CPU-seconds), swap-out from `vmstat`, critical path, timeline, top modules; artifact `experiment-<label>-<run id>` with `lake.log` (time-stamped), `vmstat.log`, `ps.log`, `time.txt`. The workflow file must exist on `main` to be dispatchable; `--ref` picks the branch to build. |
| Import graph, transitive-import waste | importGraph | `lake exe graph --to SP1Clean out.html` / `lake exe unused_transitive_imports <mods>`; `#redundant_imports`, `#min_imports` (`import ImportGraph.Tools`) | needs built oleans. `lake shake` (Lake's, the successor of Mathlib's) only runs on `module` files — usable after the `SP1Clean/` migration (#33). No `lake exe pole` exists in this dependency set; the critical path above replaces it. |

## One module

| Question | Tool | Invocation | Output / gotcha |
|---|---|---|---|
| Solo cost and Lean's category split for a set of modules | `scripts/profile_compile.sh` | `SKIP_BUILD=1 OUTDIR=.lake/profile/<tag> scripts/profile_compile.sh SP1Clean/Proofs/Chips/AddChip/` (a path prefix; `TREES=… SKIP_BUILD=1` for a full sweep, ≈ 1 h, machine idle) | `summary.tsv` (`cpu wall exit module`, CPU first), `profile.md/json` (`import`, `elaboration`, `simp`, `tactic execution`, `type checking`, `typeclass inference`, `interpretation`, `blocked`, …). Requires warm oleans; run solo (no parallel `lake`/`lean`, LSP workers reaped: `pkill -f "lean --worker"`, never `lean --server`); 3 runs, median, for a claim. |
| The same by hand | `lean --profile` / `-Dprofiler=true` | `lean $(scripts/lean_flags.py --shell) -Dprofiler=true -Dprofiler.threshold=50 <file>` (after `eval "$(lake env)"` or with `LEAN_PATH` set) | per-declaration lines above the threshold (ms) + `cumulative profiling times:`; add `-Dtrace.profiler=true` for nested timings. Categories seen here: `import`, `parsing`, `elaboration`, `type checking`, `typeclass inference`, `tactic execution`, `simp`, `dsimp`, `interpretation`, `linting`, `compilation …`, `.olean serialization`, `blocked`, `do element elaborator`, `grind …`. |
| Where inside a slow declaration is the time (a flame graph) | `trace.profiler.output` | `lean … -Dtrace.profiler=true -Dtrace.profiler.threshold=10 -Dtrace.profiler.output=prof.json <file>` then open `prof.json` at profiler.firefox.com (`-Dtrace.profiler.serve=true` serves it directly); `-Dtrace.profiler.output.pp=true` keeps full trace text, `-Dtrace.profiler.useHeartbeats=true` reports heartbeats instead of seconds | Firefox Profiler format; categories `Elab`, `Elab.async`, `Elab.block`, `Meta`, `Kernel`. This is the tool that attributes `interpretation` (which interpreted tactic/simproc) and `type checking` (which declaration hits the kernel cliff). |
| Peak memory of one module | `/usr/bin/time` | `/usr/bin/time -l lean … <file>` (macOS: "maximum resident set size" in bytes) / `-v` on Linux (kB) | the import floor is ≈ 2.6–3 GB with the Mathlib + Clean + Sail-model closure; a module's own peak is what it adds. |
| How much do the imports cost before any elaboration? | import-probe file | a one-line file `import <X>` + `example : True := trivial`, timed with `-Dprofiler=true` and `/usr/bin/time -l` | the `import` category and RSS for that root; multiply by the number of modules whose closure contains it. `lean --stats` prints the environment's import counts and bytes. |
| Is a whole file within budget under the real configuration? | `lake build <module>` | `lake build SP1Clean.Proofs.Chips.AddChip.Formal` (or `lake lean <file>`, which applies the module's setup + `moreLeanArgs`) | the only authoritative signal for a build failure or a `maxRecDepth`/heartbeat cliff (`docs/agents/proof-patterns.md`). |

## One declaration

| Question | Tool | Invocation | Output / gotcha |
|---|---|---|---|
| Heartbeats of a declaration (is it near the ceiling? how variable?) | Mathlib `#count_heartbeats` | `#count_heartbeats in theorem …` / `#count_heartbeats! 5 in …` (repeats, range and stddev) / `guard_min_heartbeats n in …`; `#count_heartbeats` alone turns on `linter.countHeartbeats` for the rest of the file | runs the command with `maxHeartbeats 0`, so it reports the true cost but not whether the real ceiling would have been hit — measure floors by lowering `maxHeartbeats` and rebuilding (`docs/agents/proof-patterns.md`). |
| What did `simp`/`whnf`/instance search unfold, and how often? | `diagnostics` | `set_option diagnostics true in` (+ `diagnostics.threshold n`) | `[reduction]` unfolded declarations/instances, `[type_class]` used instances, `[simp]` used/tried theorems, `[kernel]` unfolded declarations, `[def_eq]` heuristics — the map from a slow `simp only [circuit_norm]` to the lemma that keeps firing. |
| Which instance search is slow | `trace.Meta.synthInstance` (+ `trace.profiler`) | `set_option trace.Meta.synthInstance true in` | candidate ladders; `synthInstance.maxHeartbeats`/`maxSize` are the ceilings. |
| What a command added to the environment | Mathlib `whatsnew` | `whatsnew in <cmd>` | new declarations (e.g. the auxiliary lemmas a `deriving` or a `simp` produced). |
| A quick per-line profile from the editor | lean-lsp MCP `lean_profile_proof` | tool call with file + line | runs `lake env lean --profile -Dtrace.profiler=true` on the single declaration: **no package flags**, same-file dependencies absent; good for a first look, not for a number. |

## Reading `-Dprofiler` categories

- `import` — loading the olean closure; the per-module floor. Only import narrowing, precompiled
  or module-system oleans move it.
- `elaboration` — term elaboration outside tactics (structure/`deriving`/`let` chains, statement
  elaboration of large theorems).
- `simp` / `tactic execution` / `typeclass inference` — the tactic mix; `trace.profiler.output`
  or `diagnostics` say which call.
- `type checking` — the kernel; large values mean a kernel size cliff (Clean's
  `performance-problems.md`: make the expensive value opaque, state facts over variables).
- `interpretation` — tactic, simproc and `deriving` code that is not native: Mathlib's and
  Clean's tactics, this repo's own, `decide`-by-evaluation. Native code is only what the toolchain
  ships or what a library precompiles (`precompileModules`).
- `blocked (unaccounted)` — main thread waiting for async proof bodies; not a cost of its own.
- `do element elaborator` — the `do` notation elaborator (the generated Sail model's
  `print_rvfi_exec`, lean4#13858).

## Measurement pitfalls (each cost a wrong conclusion once)

- `lean -Dprofiler=true`'s `cumulative profiling times:` block goes to **stderr**; the per-event
  lines go to stdout. Capture both.
- A profiler category sum is not wall: proof bodies elaborate on parallel threads, and
  `blocked (unaccounted)` is the main thread waiting for them — it can exceed wall many times over.
  Compare `user+sys` CPU across runs, not the category sums.
- Per-module `Built` times in a parallel build are noisy: two cold builds of the same tree gave a
  median 8 % per-module difference with a long tail beyond ±15 %, while their sums differed by 5 %.
  The same configuration on two runner models differed by 18 % (hosted runners alternate CPU
  models; the experiment workflow records `lscpu`, the production jobs do not). Judge a change by
  Σ, wall and critical path across a pair; judge a module by a solo timing.
- The tool's numbers age with the toolchain: the 2026-09-20 solo sweep's "26 % interpretation,
  9 s per load/store `Formal` file" was true on v4.32.2 + the Clean fork and false one bump later
  (0.5 s). Re-sweep before citing a category split after a toolchain or Clean move.
- `interpretation` is interpreted *tactic* code (Mathlib/Clean/ours), not `decide` proofs or the
  kernel — see proof-patterns.md. The plain profiler names the interpreted constant; only
  `trace.profiler.output` names the call site.
- Run local profiles **solo**: a `lake build` in another shell (or an agent's) inflates every
  number, including `import` (measured 1.2 s → 4.8 s). And never switch git branches in a checkout
  while a `lake build` runs there — Lake reads sources as it reaches them.
- **A measurement loop can put the machine into swap and void its own results.** Eight
  elaborations of a 5 900-line file back to back left `vm_stat` at 14 M swap-outs and turned a
  34 s file into 348–673 s; the per-declaration numbers from that loop were meaningless. Check
  `sysctl vm.swapusage` / `vm_stat` before trusting a solo number, reap `lean --worker` processes
  (`pkill -f "lean --worker"`, never `lean --server`), and re-run the two configurations you
  actually want to compare back to back.
- **Do not attribute kernel time by replacing a proof with `sorry`.** `sorry` changes the
  elaboration path, not just the term: replacing one structure field of
  `divRemChip_rtypeGroundingData` with `sorry` took the file from 34 s to 673 s. Attribute with
  `-Dtrace.profiler=true` (its `[Kernel] typechecking declarations [X]` nodes name the
  declaration) and, within a declaration, by truncating the tactic block at successive points.
- `lake env lean` applies no package flags (`scripts/lean_flags.py` prints them); it also exits 0
  on a stack overflow.

## CI pitfalls (the design that answers them is in the workflow headers)

- `actions/cache` restore-key fallbacks match the **newest** entry with the prefix, blind to branch
  history: a bare `<prefix>-` fallback restored a stale lineage and rebuilt a scripts-only PR from
  scratch (582 modules, 22.5 min). `scripts/ci/cache_pick.py` chooses by first-parent lineage; no
  bare prefix fallback exists any more.
- The `path:` list is part of an entry's version hash: editing it invalidates every entry, so it
  ships with a `SP1_CACHE_VERSION` bump and one cold transition.
- A PR's entries live on `refs/pull/N/merge` and are invisible to `main`, so every merge used to
  redo the PR's build; the `handoff` job passes the build to `main` as an artifact.
- Never save the cache from a cancelled job (a truncated `.olean` behind a written trace poisons
  every later restore); `main` runs queue instead of cancelling.
- The 4-vCPU runner does not swap; the 5–11× CI-vs-solo inflation of big modules was **CPU
  oversubscription** — Lake runs `LEAN_NUM_THREADS` jobs (default = cores) and each child `lean`
  also defaults to all cores. 16 threads on 4 vCPU cost a third of the CPU-seconds; 3 jobs × 2
  threads (`LEAN_NUM_THREADS=3` + `-j2` in `moreLeanArgs`) is −17 % wall on a cold build.
- GitHub serves a job's log only after it completes; `gh run view --log` is empty in progress.
- **The full-tree `lake lint` and the conformance gates run only in `build-full`**, which a PR
  skips unless it carries the `ci:alignment` label. A PR that touches the alignment layers — or
  anything generated, `ToClean`, the pins or the exporter — must carry that label, or its
  regression lands on `main`: #51 added 3 963 generated definitions whose uniform binder block
  made `unusedArguments` fire 384 times, PR CI was green, and `main`'s next `build-full` went
  red. `guards` prints a notice naming the touched files when the label is missing.

## Measurement protocol for a build-time PR

1. **Before**: a CI pair from `build-experiment.yml` on the base and the head commit with identical
   inputs (same `restore`, same `LEAN_NUM_THREADS`), and — for a Lean-source change — the solo
   sweep of the touched modules on the base.
2. **After**: the same on the head; `scripts/build_semantics.py --compare` for the pair.
3. **Report** in the PR body: modules built, Σ `Built`, build-step wall, critical path, the touched
   modules' solo CPU before/after (median of 3), the profiler category the change claims to move,
   both run ids.
4. **Acceptance**: a Lean-source PR shows ≥ 20 % solo CPU on every module it names, adds no entry to
   `scripts/option_escapes_allowlist.txt`, leaves the axiom census unchanged and no untouched module
   consistently regressed (beyond the ≈ ±15 % per-module noise); a CI/lakefile PR moves Σ or wall
   beyond the ≈ 5 % noise floor on same-CPU runs, two repeats when the effect is small.

The package flags for any direct `lean` invocation: `scripts/lean_flags.py [--lib SP1CleanTest|LeanRV64D] [--shell]`
(package `moreLeanArgs` + `[leanOptions]`, the library's own winning on a key, as in Lake).
