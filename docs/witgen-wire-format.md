# The witgen wire format (`version: 1`)

This describes the transitional JSON export consumed by `rust/witgen-interp/`.
The intended replacement is [Clean's direct Rust export](export.md). Generated
artifacts under `.lake/witgen-export/run.*/witgen/` are instances of this format;
`scripts/witgenExport.lean` is their only writer. Paths below are relative to a fresh
output directory, and `scripts/check_witgen_export.py` gates them.

**Normative source.** This document is descriptive. The format is defined by the Clean
pin's serializer — `Clean/Circuit/WitnessExport.lean` and `Clean/Circuit/Json.lean` at
the revision recorded in `lakefile.toml` — and the
evaluation semantics by `Clean/Circuit/WitnessIR.lean` (`FExpr.eval` and friends) and
`Clean/Circuit/WitnessGeneration.lean` (`Circuit.witgen`). On any disagreement, the Lean
code wins and this file gets fixed.

## The envelope

One payload per chip, `witgen/<Chip>.witgen.json`:

```json
{"version": 1, "localLength": N, "operations": [ ... ]}
```

- `version` — the wire version; this document describes exactly `1`.
- `localLength` — the total number of witness cells the program appends (the sum of the
  `witness` fields below).
- `operations` — the chip's complete flattened operation list, in emission order, with
  all subcircuits inlined (names erased). Four operation forms:

| form | shape |
|---|---|
| witness | `{"witness": m, "code": {"steps": [...], "output": <VExpr>}}` |
| assert | `{"assert": <Expression>}` — the constraint `<Expression> = 0` |
| lookup | `{"lookup": {"table": <string>, "entry": [<Expression>, ...]}}` |
| interact | `{"interact": {"channel": <string>, "multiplicity": <Expression>, "message": [<Expression>, ...]}}` |

A **witness interpreter evaluates only the `witness` operations** and skips the rest;
they are carried so one artifact describes the whole chip (constraints and bus
interactions included) for consumers that want them.

## What the payload does *not* carry — the manifest

The wire format records neither the field, the input width, the chip name, nor the hint
schema. `witgen/<Chip>.manifest.json` fills the gap:

```json
{
  "wireVersion": 1,
  "witgenFile": "DivRem.witgen.json",
  "name": "DivRem",
  "lean": "SP1Clean.DivRemChip.circuit",
  "localLength": 210,
  "inputWidth": 36,
  "operationCounts": {"witness": 30, "assert": 321, "lookup": 0, "interact": 135},
  "hints": [],
  "hintPolicy": "a missing table, wrong width, or out-of-range row reads as the all-zero vector; padding rows rely on this default",
  "data": [],
  "field": {"name": "KoalaBear", "modulus": 2130706433}
}
```

The hint/data schemas are *derived* from the serialized payload (a walk for
`hintGet`/`dataGet` nodes), never hand-maintained. `witgen/index.json` lists all
chips with their `inputWidth`/`localLength`, in the registry order of
`SP1Clean/Soundness/SupportedMachine.lean` (a public witness-format matter).

## Variable indexing and the evaluation loop

A `GeneralFormalCircuit`'s input row occupies absolute variable indices
`0 .. inputWidth - 1`; the circuit's own cells begin at `inputWidth`. The evaluation
loop is a transcription of `Circuit.witgen` / `witgenStep`:

1. Seed a growing cell array with the `inputWidth` input values.
2. Fold over `operations` in order. On `{"witness": m, "code": {steps, output}}`:
   evaluate `steps` left to right into a locals array (each step sees only the locals
   before it), then evaluate `output` and append **exactly `m`** field elements to the
   cell array. Skip `assert`/`lookup`/`interact`.
3. The final array has length `inputWidth + localLength`.

An out-of-range cell read yields `0`.

## The four expression sorts — parse by slot, not by tag

`type` tags **collide across sorts** (`const`, `add`, `mul`, `ite`, `localVar`, `and`
each appear in two or three vocabularies), so a deserializer must be sort-directed by
the parent slot. The sorts:

**`Expression`** — the circuit-constraint AST. Tags: `var {index}` (an **absolute** cell
index), `const {value}`, `add {lhs, rhs}`, `mul {lhs, rhs}`. Appears in: `assert`,
`lookup.entry[]`, `interact.multiplicity`, `interact.message[]`, and inside `FExpr`'s
`expr` node.

**`FExpr`** — field-sorted witness expressions:

| tag | fields | semantics |
|---|---|---|
| `expr` | `expr: <Expression>` | evaluate against the cell array |
| `const` | `value: ℕ` | the field element with that canonical value |
| `localVar` | `index: ℕ` | step-local reference (a `field`-sorted step) |
| `add`, `mul` | `lhs, rhs: FExpr` | field arithmetic |
| `inv` | `arg: FExpr` | field inverse, **with `0⁻¹ = 0`** |
| `ofU64` | `arg: U64Expr` | lift: the field element with value `arg` (mod p) |
| `ite` | `cond: BExpr; then, else: FExpr` | conditional |
| `listGet` | `items: [FExpr]; index: U64Expr` | item at index, **`0` if out of range** |
| `dataGet` | `table, width, row: U64Expr, col` | committed prover data read (unused by SP1's 25 chips) |
| `hintGet` | `table, width, row: U64Expr, col` | prover hint read; **missing table/row reads as `0`** |

**`U64Expr`** — u64-sorted, everything wraps mod 2⁶⁴ like Rust's `u64`:

| tag | semantics |
|---|---|
| `const {value}` | literal |
| `val {arg: FExpr}` | the field element's canonical value, **truncated** to 64 bits |
| `idx {}` | the innermost enclosing `mapRange` index (`0` outside) |
| `localVar {index}` | step-local reference (a `u64`-sorted step) |
| `add`, `mul` | wrapping arithmetic |
| `div`, `mod` | **Lean semantics: `x / 0 = 0`, `x % 0 = x`** (Rust `/`/`%` panic — guard) |
| `and`, `or`, `xor` | bitwise |
| `shiftLeft`, `shiftRight` | **shift amount masked mod 64** (`wrapping_shl`/`wrapping_shr`) |
| `ite {cond, then, else}` | conditional |

**`BExpr`** — conditions. ⚠ Three wire tags disagree with the Lean constructor names;
**the wire tags are authoritative**, and an implementation should name its cases after
them:

| tag | operands | semantics |
|---|---|---|
| `true`, `false` | — | literals |
| `eq` | FExpr | field equality |
| `u64Eq` | U64Expr | u64 **equality** (the Lean ctor is confusingly named `neq`) |
| `u64Lt` | U64Expr | u64 `<` (the Lean ctor is named `lt`) |
| `lt` | FExpr | canonical-value `<` on **field** elements (the Lean ctor is named `flt`) |
| `bit {arg: FExpr, bit: ℕ}` | | bit `i` of the canonical value is set |
| `not {arg}` | BExpr | negation |
| `and {lhs, rhs}` | BExpr | conjunction — **there is no `or` node** (De Morgan) |

There are also no subtraction or negation nodes in any sort: `x - y` is encoded as
`x + (p-1)·y`, so constants like `2130706432` (= p − 1) are common.

**`steps`** — a list of `{"sort": "field"|"u64", "value": <FExpr|U64Expr>}` let-bindings,
referenced positionally by `localVar` in the matching sort. **A sort-mismatched or
out-of-range `localVar` reads as `0`** (this is total-evaluation semantics, not an
error). Steps evaluate at `idx = 0`.

**`output`** (`VExpr`) — the vector former producing the witness cells:

| tag | semantics |
|---|---|
| `elements {elements: [FExpr]}` | a literal cell list |
| `mapRange {n, body: FExpr}` | `n` cells, the body re-evaluated with `idx = 0..n-1` |
| `envRange {n, offset}` | `n` consecutive cells read from **absolute** index `offset` |
| `bitsOf {n, arg: FExpr}` | the `n` low bits of the canonical value (field-level: `n` may exceed 64) |
| `append {left, right}` | concatenation |

## Field arithmetic

SP1's field is KoalaBear, `p = 2³¹ − 2²⁴ + 1 = 2130706433`. Field elements serialize as
their canonical value (`0 ≤ v < p`). The required operations: `+`, `·`, inverse with
`0⁻¹ = 0`, canonical value (for `val`, `lt`, `bit`, `bitsOf`), and value-to-element
(for `ofU64`; on a prime field this is just `n mod p`). `p < 2³¹`, so products fit in
`u64` — no Montgomery form is needed for a reference interpreter.

## Sharing (`steps`)

Author reused calculations with Clean's `witnessProgram` / `Witgen.M`: a monadic bind
creates an IR step, while a plain Lean `let` can expand into repeated expression trees.
DivRem's multiplication, product-limb, carry, remainder-negation and comparison programs
share their computational operands this way, with kernel-checked evaluation preservation.
The existing exportability test checks the serialized size of every DivRem witness payload.
Interpreters evaluate each step once into the locals array.

The exporter serializes the authored operations directly through Clean's
`Operations.witgenJson?`. There is no downstream sharing transformation. The JSON
interpreter remains migration evidence until Clean's Rust backend covers these chips.

## Determinism and byte stability

The exporter embeds no timestamps or revisions. `python3 scripts/check_witgen_export.py`
builds the full dependency closure, exports twice into a fresh ignored directory, checks
both outputs against the independent SP1 dumps, and requires byte-identical native files.
It then runs locked Rust tests on those files. A partial or zero-exit failed Lean run
cannot pass: the driver checks complete per-chip output, inventory and fixture coverage.

Only `export/sp1dump/` stays committed as independent source evidence. Native outputs,
logs and source/artifact fingerprints live under `.lake/witgen-export/run.*/`.
Source fingerprints include uncommitted changes; a reused run must match the current
sources and its recorded artifact hashes. Changing a pin requires fresh generation and
comparison, not relabelling old files.

## Row maps (`witgen/<Chip>.rowmap.json`)

The payload generates witness *cells*; a full trace **row** is the circuit's output
struct pushed through the audited native→Rust layout map (`ChipFaithful`'s
`reconfigure`). Those maps are fully polymorphic struct re-wirings, so applying them at
the `Expression` level yields the complete symbolic Rust row, exported per chip as:

```json
{"wireVersion": 1, "name": "Add", "rustWidth": 33,
 "row": [{"type": "var", "index": 1}, ..., <Expression>]}
```

one `Expression` (over absolute cell indices) per Rust column. Evaluating `row` after
the witgen pass reproduces the chip's SP1 trace row exactly — the reference interpreter
does this and checks it against every fixture `expectedRow`. With the payload's
`assert` operations (each the constraint `expr = 0`, checkable on the completed cells)
and `interact` operations (bus multiplicities/messages, evaluable per row for
dependency accounting), the three artifacts together contain everything needed to
generate and self-check complete SP1 trace rows.

## Differential fixtures (`testdata/<Chip>.trace.json`)

The same writer's `--testdata` mode produces per-chip differential fixtures for external
interpreters:

```json
{
  "wireVersion": 1, "chip": "DivRem", "field": {...},
  "inputWidth": 36, "localLength": 210,
  "provenance": {"events": "...names the SP1 dump and the generation-time gate...",
                 "synthetic": "..."},
  "rows": [
    {"kind": "event", "anchored": true, "inputs": [...36 values...],
     "hints": {},
     "expectedWitness": [...210 values...], "expectedRow": [...246 values...]},
    {"kind": "padding", "anchored": true, "inputs": [...],
     "hints": {},
     "expectedWitness": [...], "expectedRow": [...]},
    {"kind": "synthetic", "anchored": false, "seed": 1010, "inputs": [...],
     "hints": {...}, "expectedWitness": [...]}
  ]
}
```

The contract per row: seed the cell array with `inputs`, supply `hints`, run the chip's
witness operations; the appended cells must equal `expectedWitness` (canonical values).
Row provenance is honest:

- `"event"` (`anchored: true`) — one row per executor event of the committed SP1 trace
  dump (`export/sp1dump/<Chip>.dump.json`, produced by the `chip_traces` binary at the
  pinned extraction branch; the `provenance.events` string names the dump file and its
  `sp1Commit`). The inputs are recovered from the dumped row itself through the
  symbolic row map (every native input cell is a bare `var` column of the Rust row,
  except `is_real` on the three flag-hinted chips — Branch, ShiftLeft, ShiftRight — which is `1` on event rows); the hint tables are derived from the
  event's opcode discriminant (Branch additionally derives its `branch_branching` bit
  from the operand values, mirroring SP1's own populate). `expectedRow` is the dumped
  SP1 `generate_trace` row verbatim. **The generation-time gate**: before anything is
  written, the exporter recomputes every event row — `FlatOperation.witgen` over the
  authored operations, then the symbolic row map evaluated at the resulting cells — and
  requires cell-for-cell equality with the dump, plus a value-level
  `circuitTraceRowMapped` spot check on event row 0. Present for **all 25 chips**.
- `"padding"` — the empty-hint row, inputs recovered from the dumped padding row.
  `anchored: true` only where SP1 *derives* its padding rows by running populate
  (ShiftLeft, ShiftRight, and DivRem — whose `expectedRow` is SP1's non-zero
  "0 divided by 1" template, reproduced from explicit selector inputs); these are gated
  like event rows. The remaining chips zero-fill their padding without running
  populate — the exporter asserts their dumped padding is all-zero and emits the row
  as a plain differential vector (`anchored: false`).
- `"synthetic"` (`anchored: false`) — deterministic seeded inputs (witness generation
  is total, so every input is valid), with 0/1-valued seeded hint rows for the
  declared tables. All 25 chips carry these.

`expectedWitness` is always the Lean reference evaluation (`FlatOperation.witgen`) over
the authored operation list — the same programs Clean serializes.

## Whole-ensemble instances

The retained legacy fixtures use a version-1 ensemble envelope. It has
`version`, `modulus`, `components`, `verifier`, `channels`, and `fixedTables` fields. Each component
has `name`, `inputWidth`, and `program` (the witness format above). A channel has `name` and `width`;
a fixed table has `name`, `width`, and canonical field-element `rows`. The verifier is a component
with zero local witness length and runs exactly once on the public input. Names are unique within
each inventory. Component order determines trace-table order.

Trace JSON has `version: 1`, `publicInput`, and `tables`; tables contain complete native rows,
including witness cells. No SP1 reconfiguration or Rust row map is involved. Check it with:

```sh
cargo run --manifest-path rust/witgen-interp/Cargo.toml -- check-ensemble \
  --instance export/ensemble/lookup.instance.json --trace export/ensemble/lookup.valid.json
```

The checker rejects wrong widths, noncanonical values, missing/ambiguous lookup and channel
descriptors, failed lookups/assertions, and unbalanced messages. Every interaction occurrence,
including multiplicity zero, counts towards Clean's strict characteristic bound. Fixed-table
contents belong to the instance, never to witness data. The Lean exporter requires a proof that
these contents realize each original lookup predicate independently of prover data.

The Rust `Instance.build_rows` library API runs witness programs for already assembled table
inputs and then checks the complete ensemble. Event routing and provider construction remain
separate compiler work. This executable AIR checker is not a cryptographic verifier; relying on
its acceptance trusts the instance's provenance, serialization, and Rust implementation.

The legacy ensemble serializer has been removed. The committed `export/ensemble/` files remain
historical inputs to the JSON interpreter's parser and acceptance regressions.
`scripts/ensembleExportFixture.lean` now uses Clean's built-in Rust emitter and writes only ignored
build artifacts. `bash scripts/check_ensemble_export.sh` compiles that fresh Rust, compares its
witnesses with Lean and exercises Clean's proof backend; see [export](export.md).

## SP1-specific facts a consumer may rely on

- The 25 instruction chips have empty `data` schemas. Some use `hintGet`; Bitwise, Lt, ShiftLeft, Mul and DivRem
  supply their variant selectors as inputs and read no external hints. Bitwise, Lt, ShiftLeft and Mul derive activity
  from their three, two, two and five selectors; DivRem supplies seven selectors and derives DIVU.
- Every hint read is at constant row `0`. The three remaining hint tables and widths are
  in the manifests (`branch_flags` 6, `branch_branching` 1,
  `shift_right_flags` 4).
- Missing hints read as zero vectors. DivRem's DIVU padding instead uses seven zero
  selector inputs and a divisor read of one; its derived DIVU witness is one.
