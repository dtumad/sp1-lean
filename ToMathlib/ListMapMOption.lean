/-! # Pointwise meaning of successful optional list traversal

## Gap against upstream

Lean supplies `List.mapM_cons`, and Mathlib supplies `List.Forall₂` and its indexed
characterizations. The equivalence between a successful optional traversal and pointwise
successful observations is missing. It lets readers reason about byte sequences without
unfolding nested option binds at each consumer.
