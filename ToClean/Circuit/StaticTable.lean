/-! # Static lookup tables from concrete rows

## Gap against upstream

Clean's `StaticTable` asks each caller for an indexed row function and a proof that its image
equals the table specification. There is no constructor for an already computed finite list.
`ofRows` supplies that common case with literal list membership as its specification and an
executable index search. Its defining predicate is independent of prover data.
