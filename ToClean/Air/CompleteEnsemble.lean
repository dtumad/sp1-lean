/-! # Sound and complete flat ensembles

## Gap against upstream

Clean defines both `Ensemble.Soundness` and `Ensemble.Completeness`, but its `FormalEnsemble`
bundles only soundness. `CompleteEnsemble` adds the missing direction without modifying that
interface. `EnsembleCompiler` additionally records a proof-independent partial witness constructor:
it rejects invalid candidate executions and succeeds on every execution in the semantic relation.

The specification remains a relation on semantic executions, independent of the circuit witness.
In particular, compiler success is a conclusion of completeness, never its domain definition.
These interfaces do not claim that an arbitrary Lean compiler can be exported to another language.

/-- A witness compiler for an independently defined execution relation.

`compile` consumes data, not a proof of validity. Soundness checks both the supplied execution and
the resulting AIR witness; completeness establishes success for every valid execution. The field
contains a Lean function, so executable implementations must separately avoid noncomputable code.
