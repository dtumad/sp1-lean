/-! # Exact physical ensemble accounting

Clean's raw balance condition bounds occurrence counts but has no shared interface relating them
to physical table heights and static circuit interaction widths. This addition counts the literal
ledger: zero multiplicities, duplicate keys, padding and the singleton verifier all count. The
native compiler and installed resource verifier consume these equations; no semantic execution
model or conservative admission predicate is introduced.
