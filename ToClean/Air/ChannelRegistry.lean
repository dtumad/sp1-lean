/-! # Reindexing an ensemble's channel registry

Clean channel registries are conjunctions, so repeated registrations are redundant. This
upstream-facing helper changes only that registry: physical tables, the public verifier, data,
public inputs, and every interaction occurrence remain unchanged. Full `RawChannel` membership,
including the channel predicate, is the required equivalence; matching names alone is insufficient.
