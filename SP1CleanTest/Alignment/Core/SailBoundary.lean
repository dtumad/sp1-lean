/-! # Target Sail fields checked by the real verifier subcircuit

The ADD fixture supplies a complete initialized source. These checks execute the new circuit's
assertions, including its actual public-field equations. Missing zero-valued GPRs are kept distinct
from their Memory projection, and range tests precede field conversion.
