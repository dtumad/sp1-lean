/-! # One official branch step and an accepted complete local host-ensemble witness

This is a concrete witness, not a generic completeness or final capstone theorem. The decoder,
official Sail retirement, canonical semantic projection, compiler payload, physical Branch row,
providers, fixed lookup meanings, complete target Memory and every registered channel meet here.
