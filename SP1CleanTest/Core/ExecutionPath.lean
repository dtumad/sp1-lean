/-! # Native local-path and terminal-boundary regressions

Two committed ECALLs execute ENTER followed by HALT from a non-boot clock, preserving nonempty
incoming host state and RAM. Each call is a separate semantic shard, and their joined path is the
same two-step execution. These test the semantic interface, not an AIR witness.
