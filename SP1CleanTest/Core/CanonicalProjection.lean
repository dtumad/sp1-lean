/-! # Canonical data under physical prefix projection

A wider source row becomes a narrower target row, one complete table remains, and another table
is removed. The retained key is preserved, while the removed key disappears from derived data.
These cases prevent proof views from relying on the old freely supplied data environment.
Row selection also retains duplicate occurrences and cannot discard required fixed rows.
