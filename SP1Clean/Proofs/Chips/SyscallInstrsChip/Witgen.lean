/-! # `SyscallInstrs` table: component and (for now empty) witness generation

The build-side substrate the deterministic completeness compiler needs to place SP1's syscall chip
at ensemble position 54.

**This table is empty, and that is the point of contrast with `HaltChip`.** The halt table carries
exactly one row on every shard, because its Exit contribution is a *gated pair* — `pushIf is_real`
alongside `pushIf (1 - is_real) ⟨0⟩` — so the anti-gated zero-code push is what balances the
state-boundary verifier's ungated pull, and a zero-row halt table would leave that pull unmatched.
The syscall row emits a single positively-gated Exit push instead, so an empty table contributes
`[]` on every one of the seven buses and disturbs no balance argument at all.

That makes the honest interim shape an empty row list rather than a padding row, and it is why the
facts below are vacuous rather than proved against a concrete row. When the compiler learns to emit
real syscall events (the phase that also retires `HaltChip`), `Occurrence .syscallInstrs` stops
being `Empty`, this map becomes a real row builder, and these theorems acquire a
`ComputableWitnesses` obligation that an empty table does not have. -/
