/-! # Unique event clocks from the actual local State ledger

Every active ordinary, HALT, and syscall occurrence belongs to the exhaustive State walk and
strictly advances its clock. Their incoming clocks are therefore distinct. Padding is absent
from this inventory by the physical decoder, not by an additional execution premise.
