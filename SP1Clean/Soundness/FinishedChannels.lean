/-! # Finished structural channels from actual ensemble balance

Byte and Program requirements follow from each component's raw constraints. Clean channel
consistency therefore closes every table's pull guarantees, independently of table positions.
These are structural lookup facts; committed-ROM membership remains a stronger global theorem.

pulls byte/memory and owes its refreshed memory push, the StateBump table pulls byte/state
owing nothing (the State bus has no requirements), the Halt table pulls all four gated buses
