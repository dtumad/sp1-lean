/-! # Installing queue and commitment-bank boundaries in the local verifier

The witness retains every physical instruction, handler, and resource table. Its verifier runs
queue, bank, and terminal boundaries exactly once. Projection removes those verifier emissions
without adding a table or changing canonical data; only channels unused by the boundary retain
balance. Queue ordering accounts explicitly for the verifier's two endpoint occurrences.
The final cursor, outgoing bank words, and optional exit are instance parameters. Other fields of
`bankFinal` remain unused. Active HALT uses the syscall handler; the legacy table is padding only.
Complete outgoing snapshot agreement and dynamic allocation history remain separate proofs.
