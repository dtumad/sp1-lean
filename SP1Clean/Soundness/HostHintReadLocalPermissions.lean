/-! # Authenticated permissions for installed HINT_READ writes

The real word consumers emit exactly eight unit permission pulls. All other installed host
components must likewise be consumers or silent, so the retained fixed image provider is the
only source. Its raw constraints and the ensemble's own balance authenticate each physical
byte request. The handler span and authenticated successor path supply the lower native-window
bound independently of prior RAM values and timestamps.
