/-! # New private protocols on the complete host-enabled local ledger

The public boundary verifier and 60 non-wrapper components are silent on each new registered
private protocol. Source assertions use a channel fresh for the complete host inventory.
Their silence follows from the local channel inventory and the protected store projections.
Only the physical syscall wrapper and appended auxiliary tables can contribute. This exact
ledger split preserves padding and the original characteristic count bound.
