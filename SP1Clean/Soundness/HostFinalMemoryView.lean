/-! # The installed Memory boundary as a physical proof view

The six tables below are selected from the actual host witness. They reuse the existing
boundary assembly, contracts and decoder. Byte guarantees are inherited from the enclosing
ledger. Its canonical data is derived from these six tables; fixed target RAM lookups and Byte
predicates transport separately. This view need not have balanced Byte or Memory channels.
