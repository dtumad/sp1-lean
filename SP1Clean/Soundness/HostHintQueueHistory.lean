/-! # Byte-exact queue replay from the installed AIR

Verifier-owned endpoints, actual record authentication, and exhaustive token ordering now derive
the current semantic queue at every physical HINT_LEN/HINT_READ event. Replay checks observed
length words and exact consumed lengths, and the final cursor decodes to the replay's remaining
bytes. Agreement with a separately claimed outgoing snapshot, WRITE/hook allocation edges, and
the mixed CPU/Memory execution remain separate obligations.
