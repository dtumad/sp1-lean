/-! # The complete installed queue-state ledger

HINT_READ and both HINT_LEN variants occupy fixed physical handler positions. The retained
core, other implemented handlers, and RAM word consumers are silent on queue state. Every
remaining contribution comes from the actual extra resource tables; these must eventually
implement authenticated endpoints and allocations. In particular the fixed node/word source
registration alone has no queue endpoints and admits no active queue-handler rows.
