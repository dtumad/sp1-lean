/-! # Final commitment banks of the actual local execution

Both physical bank histories agree with the same paired replay already constructed from the
mixed AIR. No bank/CPU order, successful execution, or final-bank equality is a caller premise.
This strengthens the installed source-hint theorem; complete outgoing snapshot and Exit binding,
WRITE/VERIFY installation, and constructive completeness remain separate obligations.
