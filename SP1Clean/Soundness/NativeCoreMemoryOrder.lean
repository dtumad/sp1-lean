/-! # Prior-record bounds and refresh chronology of the native core

Every produced Memory record has two bounded clock limbs: initial records have time zero,
execution writes lie inside the State walk's bounded clock interval, and refresh writes carry
Byte-checked limbs. The exact Memory balance transfers those bounds to every consumed record,
including refresh priors and the final frontier. This closes the timestamp-comparison premises
without assuming Memory truth, and supplies refresh elimination with its complete chronology.
