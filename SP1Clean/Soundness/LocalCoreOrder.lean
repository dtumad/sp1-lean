/-! # Clock ordering of the local shard assembly

Raw constraints and channel balance order every active ordinary, HALT, and syscall row between
the public endpoints. The physical StateBump rows supply canonicalization, and cancel internally.
The order retains every occurrence, including arbitrarily interleaved syscall rows.
