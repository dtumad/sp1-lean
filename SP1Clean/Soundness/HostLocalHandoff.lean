/-! # Complete instruction-to-handler accounting in the installed local AIR

Receivers are registered together with their exact unit HostCall ledger. Resource components
may use the other protocols but must be silent on HostCall. The actual physical table suffix
then determines every consumed call. Constraints and the ensemble's own balance prove a
permutation with active instruction calls, and CPU chronology gives each handler unique clocks.
No independent witness projection, ledger equation, or handler inventory is a caller premise.
