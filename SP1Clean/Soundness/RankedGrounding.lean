/-! # Ranked balance gives an exhaustive trail

Plain interaction balance produces only a subtrail; disconnected balanced cycles may remain.  VM
soundness needs a stronger statement: every real transition row occurs exactly once in the semantic
execution order.  The missing ingredient is a well-founded rank, instantiated by the decoded State
clock.  If every edge strictly raises that rank, no nonempty balanced residue can exist.

This file isolates that generic graph fact from SP1's field encodings, row decoder, and Sail semantics.
The production grounding engine must prove the two premises from the actual witness:

1. endpoint-multiset balance, supplied directly by the typed interaction-bus bridge; and
2. strict rank increase for every decoded real row, from its schedule constraints.

It then receives an exhaustive ordered trace.  Operand currency and the per-chip step theorem are a
separate induction over that trace. -/
