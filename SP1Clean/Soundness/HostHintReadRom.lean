/-! # Protected instruction memory throughout the installed mixed replay

The installed AIR supplies a complete semantic path, its ordinary write permissions and checked
source. The circuit-independent path induction then supplies configuration, protected-byte and
ROM preservation at every prefix, and actual Sail fetch agreement at every executed position.
The final boundary has no next-fetch obligation. Existing preservation statements are retained;
resource bounds and complete outgoing-boundary authentication remain separate obligations.
