/-! # ROM preservation from the actual byte footprint

The chip bridge already proves that a store frames every byte outside its committed write.
Permission for those written bytes therefore preserves instruction memory, including code sharing
an eight-byte RAM cell with writable data. No property of unrelated interpreter steps is needed.
