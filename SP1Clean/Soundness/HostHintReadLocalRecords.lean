/-! # Record authentication in the installed HINT_READ assembly

The retained core is silent on immutable hint records. The handler, word consumers, and existing
non-RAM handlers cannot create records. Fixed source components establish their own contracts;
future allocation providers must prove the same source interface. Actual whole-witness balance
therefore establishes both local channel guarantees and immutable contents for every requested
record. The store here may include future allocations; `HostHintReadLocalExecution` restricts
bindings to the current frontier using current-head truth and the actual cursor path.
