/-! # What the ensemble certifies, when a shard can also make a syscall

`SupportedCoreSailRelation` — the *conclusion* of `supported_core_native_sound` — says a shard is
either an ordinary normally-retiring `SailRetireChain` between the committed pc endpoints, or such a
prefix reaching a `SP1Halted` state parked at `haltPc`. Both arms are chains of `try_step`, and both
hard-code the clock as `8 * steps` (plus one `264` on the halting arm).

Neither can describe a shard that **commits**. A mid-shard `COMMIT` row is not a `try_step`, so no
`SailRetireChain` contains it, and the elapsed clock is no longer eight times the event count.

So the headline's conclusion has to generalize. The shape is **generalize and re-derive**, not
weaken: this file states the relation over event transcripts, and `SupportedCoreSailRelation` comes
back as its all-ordinary specialization. That specialization is the honesty check on the whole
exercise — if the existing relation is not recoverable, the generalization is wrong.

Three changes ride along, each already justified against SP1:

* **The clock is a prefix sum** of the transcript's own durations rather than `8 * steps`, because
  the row at each index decides its own window width.
* **`OrdinaryRun` loses `exit_code = 0`** (D8). Upstream leaves `exit_code` free on a non-halting
  execution shard whose `prev_exit_code` is zero — it is sticky once set and chained across shards by
  the verifier, never pinned within one. The native "Exit hand-off forces zero" is a restriction SP1
  does not make.
* **The halting arm gains the canonicity premise** (D9), because `SP1Halted` wants the exact Rust
  `SyscallCode::HALT` in `t0` and the AIR only sees byte 0. -/

/-- **The halting run shape**, generalized. The transcript's last event is the halting syscall; the
state before it is genuinely `SP1Halted`, and the final state is that state parked at `haltPc`. The
`264` is now just the last event's own duration, so it is not a special case any more.

⚠ **The `haltEvent` clause is load-bearing and was missing from the sketch.** Without it the
docstring's first sentence was a description rather than a condition: nothing tied the last *event*
to the halt, so an **all-ordinary** transcript could satisfy this shape — claiming a halt while its
final event takes eight ticks. `elapsed` would then read `8 * length` where SP1's schedule says
`8 * (length - 1) + 264`, and the two run shapes would disagree about the same shard's clock with
nothing to catch it. Requiring the last event to be a HALT syscall is what makes `elapsed` come out
to SP1's number, and it is what makes the specialization bridge's halting branch impossible rather
than merely unprovable. -/

/-! ## The specialization

On an all-ordinary transcript with zero public exit code, the event relation implies the
plain-Sail relation. The converse below starts from its ordinary run case. The zero-exit premise
is necessary because the event relation does not impose the native Exit hand-off restriction. -/

`snoc` and nothing else, so a chain cannot be read at an index — yet `OrdinaryStepsRetire` is stated
*pointwise over the trajectory*. Bridging the two run shapes in either direction needs exactly this
lemma, and its absence is why neither specialization bridge was reachable. Local to this file during
the sketch phase; it belongs beside `SailRetireChain.toSailChain`. -/

/-- **Why the converse bridge cannot be all-ordinary on the halting arm**, stated rather than left
as a remark, because it is the reason `event_of_ordinaryRun` above is restricted.

A halting Sail witness spends `8 * (steps - 1) + 264` ticks; an all-ordinary transcript of the same
length spends `8 * steps`. Those are equal only if `8 = 264`. So a halting shard's event transcript
*necessarily* contains a syscall event — which is not a defect of the bridge but the entire content
of the generalization: the 264-tick window is the thing `SailRetireChain` could never express, and
the event relation exists precisely to name it.

The consequence for the campaign is that the honest converse is arm-split, not uniform: `OrdinaryRun`
witnesses transfer verbatim, and `HaltedRun` witnesses transfer only once the halting syscall event
is constructed — which needs the handler, and so belongs with L6's live-halt-row witness rather than
here. -/
