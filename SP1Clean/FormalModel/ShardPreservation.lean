/-! # ROM preservation and official fetch for the shard's semantic domain

These are consequences of the existing `Executes` contract. Source validation and mandatory
ordinary write permission supply every premise of the mixed-path induction. No resource profile,
AIR witness or extra intermediate-state invariant is required. The final boundary may lie outside
ROM, and an empty identity, including a stopped one, needs no fetch.
