# Exact semantic relation for the native ordinary-instruction shard

This module specializes the canonical Core-shard relation for the syscall-free 25-chip native
profile.  It deliberately contains no Clean table, physical row, provider inventory, or
field-valued instruction event.  Soundness and completeness consume the same proof-free
`Machine.CoreShardSemanticWitness`; its event transcript evaluates to an ordinary official-Sail
segment whose every fetched instruction routes through the supported profile.

/-- One chronological transition retires normally, fetches, decodes, and routes to the canonical
supported profile.

The proof-free fields live in the one Model-layer `SP1TransitionView` consumed by both proof
directions. The decode is pinned once for every configured Sail state; its run at the actual source
is a projection of that shared fact, not a separate completeness premise. The compiler retains the
same projected view rather than reconstructing a completeness-only tuple. -/

/-- Every **ordinary** transition of a proof-free execution routes through the native instruction
registry.

The quantifier is arm-split rather than global.  A syscall transition's meaning does not come from
the instruction-routing profile at all: it travels in `Machine.EventStep.syscall`'s own
`SyscallTransition`, authenticated by trace validity in `CoreShardCase`.  Demanding
`SupportedSP1Transition` of it would demand `event = .ordinary`, which is exactly the restriction
this profile is dropping. -/

  ∀ located ∈ execution.locatedTransitions,

/-- **The supported halting discipline**: every ordinary transition before the terminal halt is a
supported instruction, and the ordinary prefix fits the Core row budget.  The terminal
transition's own laws — the canonical HALT code, the exit-code binding, and the endpoint
states — travel in the shared `.halted` constructor through `HaltsWith` and trace validity, so
this predicate deliberately restates none of them.

The prefix is no longer required to be all-ordinary: a halting shard may take inline syscalls
before its terminal HALT, and each such transition is authenticated by `EventStep.syscall`.  The
row budget is charged against the prefix's *ordinary* transitions, which is what the native side
supplies (`realDecodedInstructionRows`, an instruction-row count that never included syscall
rows). -/

/-- Recover the un-split routing obligation on an all-ordinary trace: every located transition is

admitted no syscall at all; with mid-shard syscalls admitted, a non-halting mixed shard is
