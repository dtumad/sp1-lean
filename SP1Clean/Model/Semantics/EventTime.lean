/-! # The event-indexed trajectory and its timeline

The timed grounding engine reads a shard through two functions of a step index `n`: the machine
state after `n` steps (`Semantics.chainState`, via `microValue`) and the bus clock at which step `n`
begins (`Semantics.Timeline.start`). Both are currently **Sail-indexed**: `chainState` is
`Machine.trajectory`, which iterates `try_step`, and the only timeline in use is
`Timeline.ordinary`, which spaces every step eight ticks apart.

That pairing is exactly right for a shard of ordinary instructions and cannot describe a syscall
row. SP1's ECALL is never executed by Sail — `Machine.EventStep.syscall` deliberately does not claim
a `SailStep`, because unmodified Sail would trap to an M-mode handler — so a syscall step is not an
iteration of `try_step`; and its clock window is `CLK_INC + 256 = 264` ticks rather than eight.

This file supplies the two generalizations, as **additions**: nothing here changes a definition the
engine already uses.

* `eventTrajectory` indexes the machine state by a transcript of `ExecutionEvent`s, executing each
  through `Machine.executeEvent?` — `try_step` for an ordinary event, the model's handler for a
  syscall. `eventTrajectory_allOrdinary` recovers `Machine.trajectory` exactly.
* `eventTimeline` derives the clock from the transcript's own durations by prefix sum.
  `eventTimeline_allOrdinary` recovers `Timeline.ordinary` exactly.

Both bridges are the shape the existing `microValueT_ordinary` / `localStepFactT_ordinary` family
already uses to keep a generalization free for its old consumers: the general definition is the one
that is true, and the uniform case is a lemma rather than a separate development.

Past the end of a transcript the timeline keeps advancing at eight ticks per step. That is not a
claim about what the machine does there — nothing does — but it is what makes `Timeline`'s `gap`
field provable for every `n`, so a finite transcript still yields a total timeline. -/

/-! ## The event-indexed trajectory -/

/-- The machine state after `n` events of `events`, executed by `handler`. Past the end of the
transcript there is no state: unlike `Machine.trajectory`, which is total because `try_step` is
always defined, an event trajectory can only step where the transcript says what to do. -/
