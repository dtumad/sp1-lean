/-! # Finite interval tables for sparse initial memory

A fixed lookup table cannot enumerate the native 48-bit address space. Constant-value intervals
represent zero-filled gaps and explicit bytes in one finite table. Each sparse update splits the
interval containing its address; the first binding in the update history still wins. No sorting,
prover-supplied nonmembership evidence, or dense memory enumeration is required.

Empty intervals are harmless: they contain no address and need no special padding semantics.
