/-! # Persistent, byte-exact hint queues

Zero denotes the empty queue. Every allocated node stores the complete hint and a smaller tail
pointer; appending nodes preserves all previous pointers. This lets host tables observe a queue
head, prepend guest or hook hints, and pop a consumed hint without copying its unchanged suffix.
No hash or trusted content oracle identifies bytes. Field encodings, resource bounds, and AIR
authentication of the node inventory remain separate from this executable representation.
