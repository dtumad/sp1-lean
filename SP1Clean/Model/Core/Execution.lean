/-! # Stateful local execution of the native core

A boundary contains the entire Sail and host states, together with the execution clock. In
particular, equal PCs and clocks do not identify a boundary: RAM, registers, pending hints and
replies, accumulated outputs, commitment banks, and terminal status must agree as well.

Ordinary steps retire normally in official Sail. ECALL steps use the concrete host interpreter,
threading its returned state. Both arms require a running source; HALT is a real transition and
there are no transitions out of a stopped state. Padding and provider/refresh rows are not
semantic steps. Supported decoding, ROM-write exclusion, and shard resource limits belong to the
native profile layered over this execution relation; no AIR correctness is asserted here.
