/-! # Complete host fields along a local execution

The existing interpreter determines terminal status from actual HALT labels. Calls other than
WRITE and VERIFY preserve public output, hook replies, requests, stdout, and stderr. This frame
is explicit here and must be derived from a physical receiver inventory before using it for AIR
soundness; it is not a restriction on the intended eight-call capstone.
