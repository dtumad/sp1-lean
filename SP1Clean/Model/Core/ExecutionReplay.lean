/-! # Replaying mixed event tapes with evolving host state

Replay consumes only the source state and event data. A host event is checked against the call
computed from the actual registers, memory, host queue, and clock; its claimed result is not used
as an oracle. The returned host state feeds the next step. Ordinary replay uses official Sail.

`ExecutionStep.replay` and `ExecutionPath.replay` establish agreement with the semantic relation.
The converse still requires normal-retirement evidence for ordinary instructions: successful
`try_step` evaluation alone also includes interpreter paths other than instruction retirement.
This semantic Sail replay is noncomputable, like the existing machine replay; it is not the
exportable row compiler. Its prefix trajectory supplies the paired state for mixed grounding.
