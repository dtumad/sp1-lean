/-! # Resource observation of the complete execution replay

This observer calls the existing replay step. It adds no transition relation and makes no
choices of intermediate states. Failed tapes have a total observation, but are excluded by
`ExecutionPath`; all composition and event-cost conclusions below use that existing relation.
