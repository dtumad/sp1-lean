/-! # The native SP1 range instance

These bounds match the pinned SP1 platform and current native encodings. The Sail snapshot
contains bytes below the guest window too; guest access permission and memory-map presence are
different notions. Changing this instance requires new Sail/encoding agreement, not only new data.
